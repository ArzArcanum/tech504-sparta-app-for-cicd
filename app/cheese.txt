I enjoy cheese.
I am fond of cheddar.
I really like brie.
I'm also partial to a bit of red leicester.
Let's not forget mozzarella, which is sublime.
Camembert is also delightful.
Those are all the cheeses that I like, at least the ones I remember.
I forgot to mention Gorgonzola, I tried it recently, it was very moreish.
